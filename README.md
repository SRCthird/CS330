# CS330

This project is a 3D OpenGL application that demonstrates basic computational graphics and visualization concepts. The program uses modern OpenGL techniques to render a 3D scene with textures, lighting, and user-controlled camera perspectives.

## How Do I Approach Designing Software?

### **What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
Working on this project allowed me to apply my ability to break down complex systems into modular components. By working with classes like `SceneManager`, `ViewManager`, and `ShaderManager`, I learned to design systems that encapsulate functionality, ensuring they are reusable and maintainable. I also gained proficiency in designing for interactivity, particularly with user input and real-time rendering.

### **What design process did you follow for your project work?**
The project followed an iterative design process:
1. **Requirement Gathering:** Understanding the project requirements, such as implementing textures, lighting, and movement.
2. **Design:** We would design the implimentations of textures, lights and movement in a different assignment then apply it to this project.
4. **Refinement:** Gradually adding features like texture loading, material definitions, and light sources.
5. **Testing and Feedback:** Regularly testing for functionality, performance, and user experience.

### **How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
- **Modularity:** Breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable components is applicable in any software development project.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Starting with a functional prototype and refining it incrementally is a robust method for tackling complex problems.
- **Scalability:** Designing for flexibility, as seen with the ability to add new materials, textures, and light sources, ensures longevity and adaptability in future projects.

## How Do I Approach Developing Programs?

### **What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
- **Shader Programming:** Writing and managing GLSL shaders for vertex and fragment processing was a new skill developed during this project.
- **Resource Management:** Efficiently loading and managing textures and materials to avoid memory leaks or rendering errors.
- **Input Handling:** Developing a seamless interface for handling keyboard and mouse input for real-time interaction with the 3D scene.

### **How did iteration factor into your development?**
Iteration was central to the development process:
- Initial builds focused on establishing a working rendering pipeline with basic shapes and shaders.
- Subsequent iterations added complexity, such as camera movement, texture mapping, and lighting effects.
- Feedback from testing guided iterative improvements, ensuring the application met its goals while addressing bugs and performance issues.

### **How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
Early milestones involved experimenting with OpenGL basics and building familiarity with libraries like GLEW, GLFW, and GLM. As the project progressed, I adopted a more structured approach:
- Clearer separation of concerns between classes and functions.
- A greater focus on code reusability and readability.
- Using debug tools and output messages to streamline troubleshooting.

## How Can Computer Science Help Me in Reaching My Goals?

### **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
Computational graphics has deepened my understanding of:
- **Mathematics in Computer Science:** Transformations, vectors, and matrix operations used in rendering.
- **Real-Time Systems:** Managing real-time processes such as rendering, input handling, and updates.
- **Interdisciplinary Applications:** Integrating computer science principles with design, physics, and user experience.

These skills provide a strong foundation for exploring advanced topics in computer graphics, game development, or scientific visualization in future studies.

### **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
Professionally, the skills gained are invaluable in fields such as:
- **Game Development:** Understanding the rendering pipeline, shader programming, and 3D modeling.
- **Simulation and Visualization:** Developing applications for simulations or visualizing complex data, applicable in industries like aerospace, healthcare, and education.
- **Interactive Design:** Leveraging user-centered design principles for creating immersive and interactive 3D environments.
